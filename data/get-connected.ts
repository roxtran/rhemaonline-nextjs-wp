      '<p>Our outreach is the extension of the Rhema mission and vision into impoverished and needy areas of our world. Working in close partnership with local and global communities on initiatives such as the feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, sheltering the homeless, providing medical care, education, and empowering those most in need Missions is the continuity of the timeless ministry of Jesus Christ to those in our world who are otherwise forgotten and left bereft of the necessities and opportunities of life.</p>',
