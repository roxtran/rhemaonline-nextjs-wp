              Men of Valor is a social network of men across Canada with a
              mandate to explore critical issues facing men of all ages in the
              21st century and the role that Godâ€™s Kingdom plays in bringing
              solutions to these issues. The fellowship is also tasked with
              developing and executing programs that ensure that men are
              building healthy relationships, pursuing purpose with a good
              understanding of work-life balance, and providing opportunities
              for mentoring and nurturing the sons of the next generation.
