            Established in the fall of 1999 under the leadership of our Senior Pastor, Orim M. Meikle, Rhema Christian
            Ministries, Canada, is a multi-ethnic, non-denominational ministry located in the world-class city of
            Toronto. With a mandate to Change & And Affect Lives, we have grown quickly from a small congregation into a
            vibrant and flourishing community.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using a holistic approach to life, we incorporate all aspects of living into one essential organization. Our
            ministries and services are dedicated to promoting spiritual well-being, physical well-being, and economic
            empowerment. At Rhema, we develop people to achieve their full potential in life through products and
            services that meet people at the point of their need.
          </p>
          <p>
            Guided and fueled by the Holy Spirit, we have been graced to transcend denominational and cultural
            boundaries, creating a fresh and innovative template for 21st-century Christianity in Canada and worldwide.
            With God leading us, the Rhema future is very bright.
