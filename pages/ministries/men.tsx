              Men of Valor is a social network of men across Canada with a mandate to explore critical issues facing men
              of all ages in the 21st century and the role that Godâ€™s Kingdom plays in bringing solutions to these
              issues. The fellowship is also tasked with developing and executing programs that ensure that men are
              building healthy relationships, pursuing purpose with a good understanding of work-life balance, and
              providing opportunities for mentoring and nurturing the sons of the next generation.
