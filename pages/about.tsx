            Established in the fall of 1999 under the leadership of our Senior Pastor, Orim M. Meikle, Rhema Christian
            Ministries, Canada is a multi-ethnic, non-denominational church with campuses in Toronto and Ottawa. With a
            mission to change and affect lives, in a short period of time, Rhema has grown from a small congregation
            into a flourishing multicultural community.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using a holistic approach to modern day living, Rhema is incorporating all aspects of living into one
            essential organization. Its ministry and services are dedicated to the promotion of spiritual well-being,
            physical well-being, as well as the economic empowerment of the individual. In short Rhema is developing a
            people to achieve their full potential in life irrespective of socio-economic conditions or ethnic
            backgrounds.
          </p>
          <p>
            Propelled by the Spirit of God Rhema has been graced to transcend all denominational as well as cultural
            boundaries, creating a fresh and innovative template for the 21st century, which has come to characterize
            this new and cutting edge form of Christianity in Canada.
