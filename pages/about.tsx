          <p>
            Established in the fall of 1999 under the leadership of our Senior
            Pastor, Orim M. Meikle, Rhema Christian Ministries, Canada is a
            multi-ethnic, non-denominational church with campuses in Toronto and
            Ottawa. With a mission to change and affect lives, in a short period
            of time, Rhema has grown from a small congregation into a
            flourishing multicultural community.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using a holistic approach to modern day living, Rhema is
            incorporating all aspects of living into one essential organization.
            Its ministry and services are dedicated to the promotion of
            spiritual well-being, physical well-being, as well as the economic
            empowerment of the individual. In short Rhema is developing a people
            to achieve their full potential in life irrespective of
            socio-economic conditions or ethnic backgrounds.
          </p>
          <p>
            Propelled by the Spirit of God Rhema has been graced to transcend
            all denominational as well as cultural boundaries, creating a fresh
            and innovative template for the 21st century, which has come to
            characterize this new and cutting edge form of Christianity in
            Canada.
